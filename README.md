This is a P2P chat and simple file-sharing app, that connects two deivce on  the same network using IP address and port numbers. The app is written in JAVA for the android platform and requires both device to support SDK 21 & higher.
We used native java socket libraries to create the network sockets. Additionally, color picker library was used to help with Background color changing process.

This application fulfills all the base features of the assignment, as given below:
1. Devices are connected as peers through IP address and port.
2. An intuitive GUI to write, send and receive messages and use other features.
3. Material menubar that with feature options as menuitems.
4. Option to store current chat session.
5. Option to change background color together with the connected device.
6. Can send text files.


ADDITIONAL FEATURES:
1. Possible to send any types of files including .c, .xml, .png,.jpeg etc
2. Sent and received images are shown on chat screen
3. Time is attached with the sent and the received texts.
4. Gives notifications if devices are disconnected.
5. Users can control background color opacity.


Be careful to :
1. Always double check the IP address and port numbers.
2. Upload file from actual file location in the device, and not shortcuts.
3. Restart the app if the internet connection is reset.
